"""
Resolving the long-code ambiguity acquisition leaves.

Two signals, one mechanism.  L2C acquires on CM's 20 ms period and leaves CL --
75 times longer -- unlocated; L5 acquires on I x NH10's 10 ms composite and leaves
NH20's 20 ms half-resolved.  Both come down to scoring a handful of candidate
offsets against the dwell that acquisition already used.

The L2C case is not merely an enhancement: until it runs, the tracking channel
generates CL from the phase CM supplied, i.e. as though CL sat at its code origin.
That is right 1 time in 75, and the synthetic generator agrees with the channel by
construction, so nothing else in the suite can catch it.
