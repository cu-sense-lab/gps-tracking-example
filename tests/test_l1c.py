"""
GPS L1C end to end: acquisition, tracking, and overlay sync.

L1C is the first signal here that is not BPSK and the first whose primary code
period (10 ms) is longer than one correlation interval.  `test_l1c_codes.py` proves
the code sequences against IS-GPS-800J and `test_subcarrier.py` proves the kernel;
this module is about the parts that only appear once those are assembled into a
signal:

  - acquisition folding the subcarrier into its replica, and what happens if it
    does not,
  - the 25/75 power split reaching the delay discriminator,
  - the 10 ms primary period driving overlay wipe-off, and the four-quadrant
    discriminator it buys,
  - the ceiling on coherent integration being L1CD's CNAV-2 symbol rather than the
    overlay -- which is the opposite of L5, and easy to get wrong.
