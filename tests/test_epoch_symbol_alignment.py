"""
The epoch grid must open on a real data symbol boundary, not on a convenient one.

Both regressions here are the same mistake seen from two sides: code that decides
where a symbol starts by looking at the code phase lattice alone, on signals where
that lattice says nothing about the data.

`TrackingChannel` anchors its epoch grid on multiples of the symbol period in
*code phase*.  That is a symbol boundary only once something has tied the code
phase counter to the data -- an overlay's phase, or a primary code period at least
as long as the symbol.  GPS L1 C/A has neither: a 1 ms code under a 20 ms bit, and
an acquisition code phase known only modulo one code period, so the counter's
origin is an arbitrary code period and its 20 ms lattice sits an unknown 0-19 ms
away from the bit lattice.  Anchoring on it regardless misplaces every epoch by
that offset, and the offset survives into the pseudorange as a whole number of
milliseconds -- 300 km each, which is why this is worth its own file.

The fixtures deliberately generate signals whose bit boundary is NOT on a multiple
of 20 ms of code phase.  Leaving it there (the generator default) makes the buggy
and the correct anchor agree, which is exactly how this went unnoticed.
