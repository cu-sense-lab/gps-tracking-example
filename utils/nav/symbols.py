"""
From tracking outputs to navigation-message symbols.

The decoders in this package take soft symbols, one per data symbol.  A tracking
channel produces prompt correlator values, one per *epoch*, and an epoch is not
generally a symbol.  This module is the bridge, and it exists as its own file
because the mapping is different for every signal and each difference is a
property of the signal rather than of the decoder:

    signal   data component   symbol    where the boundary comes from
    ------   --------------   ------    -----------------------------
    L1 C/A   0 (the only one)  20 ms    statistical bit sync -- nothing else exists
    L2C      0 (CM)            20 ms    the CM code period IS the symbol
    L5       0 (L5I)           10 ms    NH10 overlay sync
    L1C      0 (L1CD)          10 ms    L1CD's code period; L1CO gives the frame

The two things that make this more than a reshape:

**Epoch length changes mid-run.**  Every channel opens at one 1 ms correlation
interval, and `TrackingChannel._maybe_extend_coherent_duration` lengthens the
coherent accumulation to the configured duration once the PLL has locked and the
symbol boundary is known -- on L5, 1 ms to at most 10 ms.  So the same output array
holds epochs of two different lengths, and only the longer ones tile whole symbols.
That is what `outputs.epoch_duration_ms` is for.

**Not every epoch is usable.**  Two edges have to be behind the channel before its
epochs are symbols.  Until the overlay is synced the tiered code is still flipping
the data component's sign every code period; and until the carrier loop is in PLL
the epochs have random relative phase, so summing them cancels rather than
integrates.  Epochs before either edge are dropped rather than salvaged -- see
`_usable_slice`, which explains why salvaging them would fail silently.

What this module deliberately does not do is resolve the carrier's 180 degree
phase ambiguity.  That is not knowable here; it is knowable at frame sync, where a
preamble either matches or does not, so `cnav.decode` and `lnav.decode` handle it.

        Signal-to-noise ratio of one symbol, in dB, measured off the two axes.

        The data axis carries signal plus noise; the axis 90 degrees from it
        carries noise alone.  That second fact is what makes this cheap -- the
        noise power is not modelled, it is measured on an axis the signal is not
        supposed to be on:

            N = mean(quadrature axis squared)    noise power per axis
            S = mean(data axis squared) - N      what is left on the data axis

        Subtracting rather than reading the data axis as signal is what keeps the
        estimate honest at low SNR, where most of what sits on that axis is noise.

        This is the SNR of one **symbol**, after its epochs were summed -- not
        C/N0, which is a density and is what `utils.tracking_channel` estimates
        per correlation interval.  They differ by the symbol duration:
        `C/N0 = SNR + 10*log10(1/T)`, so a 20 ms symbol sits about 17 dB below the
        C/N0 figure notebook 01 plots and a 10 ms symbol about 20 dB below.
        Comparing the two is a real check -- they are measured on different
        quantities at different rates -- but only a rough one, since this makes no
        allowance for the coherence the summing actually achieved.

        Returns -inf when the data axis holds no more power than the quadrature
        one.  That is not a weak signal but a signal on the wrong axis: the carrier
        is not locked the way `DATA_IN_QUADRATURE` says it is, and the decoder is
        about to be handed the noise axis.  Worth seeing before blaming the decoder
        for failing to sync.  A residual carrier phase error tilts the estimate the
        same way, by rotating signal onto the noise axis, so this reads low rather
        than high when phase lock is poor.
