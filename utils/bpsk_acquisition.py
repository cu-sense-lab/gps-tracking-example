    Localised refinement of an already-detected peak.

    The coarse search resolves delay to one sample and Doppler to one FFT bin, and
    the residual costs real signal power.  At 22 Msps against a 10.23 Mcps code one
    delay bin is 0.465 chips, so a worst-case half-bin error sits at 0.233 chips on
    the correlation triangle -- **-2.3 dB**.  The equivalent Doppler error, half of
    a 50 Hz bin over a 5 ms coherent integration, costs only -0.22 dB.  Delay is
    worth an order of magnitude more here, which is why the default window is wider
    on delay than on Doppler.

    Halfwidths are in *coarse bins*, so their physical span depends on the sample
    rate and the code: +/-3 bins is +/-1.40 chips on L5 at 22 Msps, but +/-0.14
    chips on L1 C/A at the same rate.

    The refined grid is a uniform sub-division that **contains the coarse bins**:
    offsets run over `[-halfwidth*factor, +halfwidth*factor]` in steps of
    `1 / factor` of a bin, so with halfwidth 3 and factor 2 the taps are
    -3, -2.5, -2, ... +2.5, +3 bins and the coarse bins are the even ones.  That
    subset property is what makes the fine grid directly comparable to the coarse
    one.

    """
    Acquisition dwell layout.

    Two lengths, and they are not the same thing:

    `coherent_duration_replica_ms` is the replica -- and therefore the FFT -- length.  The
    correlation is circular, so this must be a whole number of code periods or the
    wraparound matches the data against the wrong chips.

    `coherent_duration_sample_ms` is how much data goes into one coherent integration.
    It defaults to the replica length, which is what every caller did before it
    existed.  Setting it shorter zero-pads each block up to the replica length,
    and `num_blocks` of them are then summed by square law.

    Shortening it is how a signal whose data symbol is no longer than its code
    period gets acquired at all.  GPS L2 CM is the case in point: its 20 ms code
    period is exactly its CNAV symbol, so a 20 ms coherent integration at an
    arbitrary alignment straddles a symbol boundary.  There is a 50% chance of a
    flip, and when one happens the surviving amplitude is |2a - 1| for a boundary
    a fraction `a` of the way through -- a null when it lands mid-window.  Four
    5 ms blocks put at most one boundary inside any single block.

    The two lengths drive different things, which is the point of separating them:

        Doppler grid spacing   = 1 / replica_duration    (FFT bin width)
        Doppler response width = 1 / coherent_duration   (correlation mainlobe)

    With a short coherent length the grid is finer than the response, so the
    residual Doppler error is set by the grid rather than by the mainlobe.

    `fine_search` optionally refines each *detected* peak afterwards, over a small
    window around it -- see `FineSearchParameters`.  `None` disables it, which is
    the default: the coarse search alone is unchanged by this feature.

    The search grid decides how far off the seed handed to tracking can be:

        code phase, worst case = +/- 0.5 sample / delay_factor
        Doppler,    worst case = +/- 0.5 * fft_resolution / doppler_factor

    Lay each coherent block into a full-length FFT window, zero elsewhere.

    A block shorter than the replica has to be zero-padded, and *where* the data
    sits in that window matters.  Block `j` was received at samples
    `[j * coherent_length, ...)`, so the code had already advanced that far; its
    correlation peak therefore sits at lag `p + j * coherent_length`.  Padding
    every block at position 0 would leave each peak at a different lag and the
    square-law sum would smear them across the code phase axis instead of
    stacking them.

    Placing block `j` at the offset it actually occupied within the code period --
    `j * coherent_length` modulo the period -- puts every peak back at the same
    lag `p`.  Equivalently: each block is the whole dwell window with everything
    outside its own slice zeroed, so all blocks share one time origin.

    Zero-padding the *data* rather than the replica is what keeps the circular
    correlation valid: the replica stays a whole code period, so its wraparound

    Perform BPSK acquisition on the given sample block for all signals defined in code_parameters.

    Returns a dictionary mapping signal IDs to their respective AcquisitionResult.

    `prob_false_alarm_total` is the chance that *any* cell in one signal's search
    grid false-alarms -- a number that keeps its meaning when the sample rate,
    replica length or Doppler range change.  It is converted to a per-cell rate
    here; callers should not pre-correct it.  Across a sweep of P satellites,
    expect about `P * prob_false_alarm_total` false acquisitions, so this is the
    knob for trading sensitivity against false alarms:

        1e-3   sensitive: ~0.03 false acquisitions per 32-PRN sweep
        1e-6   balanced (about 1 dB stricter than 1e-3 on a large grid)
        1e-9   conservative; the extra ~0.7 dB buys little, because what actually
               produces false acquisitions in GNSS is cross-correlation against a
               strong satellite, which no threshold setting addresses.

    Pre-computed replicas and FFTs are stored for each signal in the config `replica_cache_dict`.
    The values in the cache entries must be recomputed when acquisition parameters change or when the sampling rate changes.

    Options for noise variance estimation:
        "abscorrmean": compute noise variance from the mean of abs(corr)**2 matrix
        "abscorrvar": compute noise variance from the square root of the variance of abs(corr)**2 matrix

    `save_corr_doppler_window_bins` controls how much of each signal's
    delay-Doppler matrix is *kept* in the returned `CorrelationResult`; detection
    itself always uses the whole thing.  `1` (the default) keeps the peak Doppler
    bin and one either side, with the full code-delay axis -- 704 MB per signal
    becomes about 5 MB, which matters because a 32-PRN sweep otherwise retains
    ~22 GB.  The delay axis is the one worth keeping: multipath lives there, and at
    22 Msps one code-phase bin is 45 ns, about 14 m.  `None` keeps the full grid,
    which is needed for anything reading the Doppler response
    (`plotting.plot_acquisition_doppler_slices`) or the whole-grid noise
    distribution (`plotting.plot_acquisition_correlation_histogram`).

    Rows outside the searched grid are filled with NaN rather than clipped away, so
    the retained matrix is always `2 * window + 1` rows and the peak is always the
    centre row -- true even for a signal whose Doppler lands at the edge of the
    search range.  Consumers must use the `nan*` reductions.

    Sub-bin Doppler refinement is configured by `acq_config.fine_search_factors`.
    A Doppler factor of `k` repeats the search with the samples shifted down by
    `j/k` of a bin for each `j`, keeping whichever pass peaks highest -- so the
    worst-case Doppler error falls to `1/k` of half a bin, at `k` times the cost.
    It matters whenever the seed would otherwise be looser than the tracking loop
    can pull in from.
