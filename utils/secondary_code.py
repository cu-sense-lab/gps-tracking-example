"""
Tiered (secondary / overlay) codes: synchronisation and wipe-off.

Some signals modulate a short code on top of the primary one, advancing by one
overlay chip per primary code period.  GPS L5 carries Neuman-Hofman overlays --
NH10 on I, NH20 on Q -- and GPS L1C carries a 1800-symbol L1CO overlay on its
pilot.

Why it matters: until the overlay is stripped, a "dataless" pilot is not actually
dataless.  Its sign flips once per code period exactly like data, which forces a
Costas discriminator and caps coherent integration at one period.  Removing the
overlay is what buys the pilot its advantage.

ONE COUNTER
-----------
Every overlay on a signal advances on the same primary-code-period boundary, so a
single counter drives all of them: component `c` uses
`overlay_c[counter % len(overlay_c)]`.  Synchronising the counter modulo
`lcm(len(overlay_c) for all c)` therefore fixes every component's phase at once.
For L5 that is `lcm(10, 20) = 20`: locking NH20 on the pilot also locks NH10 on
the data component -- and since NH10's period is exactly the 10 ms CNAV symbol,
that delivers symbol synchronisation for free.

The synchroniser is deliberately separated from the search strategy.  Brute force
over every offset is fine for NH10/NH20, but L1C's 1800-symbol overlay makes it
O(1800^2); that will want an FFT-based circular correlation, which can be dropped
in without touching the state machine.
